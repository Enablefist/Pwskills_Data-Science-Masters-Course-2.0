    "#Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.\n",
    "#Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.\n",
    "#Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.\n",
    "#Assigning Values to Variables\n",
    "#Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "#The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "#The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.\n",
    "#For example −\n",
    "#Example\n",
