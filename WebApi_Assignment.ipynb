    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.\n",
    "In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.\n",
    "For example, when you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server.\n",
    "The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone.\n",
    "The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way.\n",
    "This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.\n",
    "To explain this better, let us take a familiar example.\n",
    "Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from.\n",
    "The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order.\n",
    "What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table.\n",
    "That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do.\n",
    "Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food. \"\"\""
